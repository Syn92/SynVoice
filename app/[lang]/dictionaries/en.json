        "designation": "Restaurant Owner",
        "company": "Tacotac, Montreal, Canada",
        "testimonial": "Before we started using SynAI’s voice agent, we were easily missing 15–20 calls a day, especially during lunch and dinner service. That meant dozens of potential customers lost each week and growing frustration for our clientele.\n\nSince implementing SynAI, we’ve cut missed calls by 36 % and seen a 19 % increase in phone reservations in under two months. The agent automatically answers common questions and books tables directly in our OpenTable system.\n\nMost impressive: everything was set up and running in less than two weeks, and we didn’t have to change our phone number. Customers hardly noticed—except their wait times dropped and they get better information.\n\nI recommend this solution 100 % to any restaurateur who can’t afford a full-time receptionist. It’s like hiring an ultra-reliable employee for a third of the cost."

        "company": "El Consul Mao, Spain",
        "testimonial": "We first deployed SynAI’s Voice Agent in a highly targeted way—only during closing hours, from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m.—to serve callers from other time zones, especially our U.S. guests. In less than a month, the agent handled over 31 % of overnight calls and achieved a 93 % customer-satisfaction rating (based on our post-interaction survey).\n\nThe most common inquiries were about room availability, cancellation policies, and parking options—simple yet time-consuming questions.\n\nImpressed by the results, we moved to phase 2: a full 24/7 rollout. Since then, our front-desk team spends 38 % less time on the phone and can focus on in-person check-ins and arrivals.\n\nOur average occupancy rate rose from 72 % to 78 % in just three months, largely thanks to the agent’s ability to capture bookings that used to slip through after hours.\n\nThe SynAI team guided us through every step; I wholeheartedly recommend their service."

        "testimonial": "Before partnering with SynAI, our receptionist was fielding 80–100 calls a day, and patients often reached voicemail—especially around lunchtime or late in the afternoon.\n\nWe brought in SynAI’s voice agent to take over whenever the line is busy or outside office hours. In under two months, missed appointments (no-shows) dropped by 22 %, largely thanks to automated reminders. Our receptionists now handle fewer calls overall, but each one is more meaningful, because routine questions are resolved automatically.\n\nThe real game-changer was SynAI’s hands-on support. They invested time to learn our workflows, terminology, and patient needs. Together we built a tailored knowledge base—covering insurance, treatments, appointment policies—and everything went live quickly.\n\nToday, our staff feels less pressure, and patients get better service no matter when they call. SynAI is more than just technology for us; it’s a genuine partner in our commitment to quality care."
