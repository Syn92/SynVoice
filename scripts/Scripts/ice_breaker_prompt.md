### 1. Company Suitability Analysis
First, determine if this company is suitable for voice agent services. **EXCLUDE** companies that:
- Are large franchises or corporations (500+ employees) without customer service needs
- Are retail chains like Jean Coutu, McDonald's, Walmart, etc.
- Don't have phone-based customer interactions (pure e-commerce, software companies, etc.)
- Are government agencies or non-profits
- Have no clear need for appointment booking, customer service, or phone support

**INCLUDE** companies that would benefit from voice agents for:
- Appointment booking (clinics, salons, spas, fitness centers, etc.)
- Customer service and support
- Lead qualification and follow-up
- Reservation systems (restaurants, hotels, services)
- Order taking and processing
- Information and FAQ handling

### 2. Research Enhancement (Use Google Search When Needed)
You have access to Google Search to get real-time information about companies. Use this capability when you need additional context for:
- Recent company developments, expansions, or news
- Specific services they offer that could benefit from voice automation
- Current industry trends or challenges they might face
- Company size verification or recent growth
- Any missing information that would help create a more targeted ice breaker

**When to search:** If the provided company information is limited or you want to verify current details, use Google Search to enhance your understanding.

### 3. Ice Breaker Generation
If the company IS suitable, create a personalized ice breaker that:
- **Opens with a specific observation** about their business, industry, or recent development
- **Identifies a relevant pain point** they likely face with phone/customer communications
- **Briefly mentions the solution** (voice agent technology) without being pushy
- **Includes a soft call-to-action** for a brief conversation
- **Keeps it under 100 words**
- **Sounds natural and conversational**

### 4. Output Format
If the company should be **EXCLUDED**, respond with: "EXCLUDE: [brief reason]"

If the company is **SUITABLE**, provide only the ice breaker text without any additional formatting or explanations.

## Example Good Ice Breakers:

**For a dental clinic:**
"Hi [Name], I noticed Action Sport Physio has grown to 35+ locations across Quebec - impressive expansion! With that growth, I imagine managing appointment bookings and patient inquiries across all locations can be challenging, especially during peak hours. We've helped similar multi-location healthcare practices reduce missed calls by 80% using voice AI that handles bookings 24/7. Would you be open to a quick 10-minute conversation about how this could support your continued growth?"

**For a restaurant:**
"Hi [Name], I see [Restaurant Name] has been getting great reviews for your [specific cuisine/feature]. With the busy dinner rushes, I imagine managing reservations and takeout orders can get hectic when the phones are ringing non-stop. We've helped restaurants like yours capture 40% more orders by using voice AI that never puts customers on hold. Worth a brief chat about how this could help during your busiest times?"

## Remember:
- Be specific and personalized
- Focus on their likely pain points
- Keep it conversational, not salesy
- Include relevant business details
- Make the value proposition clear but subtle
